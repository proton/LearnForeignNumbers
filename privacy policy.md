Hey there! At Learn Number, I'm all about keeping things private. The app doesn't collect any data from your device, and we don't use any sneaky third-party tools to track your usage of our app.

In other words, the app wouldn't ask, use or share your name, email, phone number, location, or any other personal info.
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, just give me a shout at psavichev@gmail.com.

Thanks for choosing Learn Number app, and for trusting me to keep your data safe and private. I promise to always have your best interests in mind!
